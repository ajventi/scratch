Connecting to Vinho Host: 

Keyfile is Vinho-key1.pem

SSH Connection: 
the pgtunnel script works

$ ssh -i Vinho-key1.pem ajv@ec2-107-21-218-23.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Tunnelling and using

database connection

$ psql -p5432 -hlocalhost -Uajv vvinves


**** Ideas moving forward:

* Powershell SQL queries:

The SqlClient object seems to be the thing

> $foo = new-object -typename System.Data.SqlClient.sqlconnection
> get-member -InputObject $foo

This seems to be only for MSSQL  (from .NET docs)
"A SqlConnection object represents a unique session to a SQL Server data source. With a client/server database system, it is equivalent to a network connection to the server. SqlConnection is used together with SqlDataAdapter and SqlCommand to increase performance when connecting to a Microsoft SQL Server database. For all third-party SQL Server products and other OLE DB-supported data sources, use OleDbConnection. "
